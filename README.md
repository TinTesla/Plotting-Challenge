# Plotting-Challenge
 Module 5

I don't see any mention of a written response to this challenge. Hopefully that isn't an issue.

I had a few issues with this lesson, and I wasn't able to figure it out in time. I tried reviewing the practice examples and did some Google searches, but I did fall short on a few of the challenges in this assignment. Hoping that my best attempts are valid for partial credit on some of them. My apologies for not meeting the full criteria of the assignment.
